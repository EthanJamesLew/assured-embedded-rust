# Blinky Example

![Blinky Demo](../../doc/img/blinky.gif)

A simple example of controlling LEDs from a push button using an "assured" development pipeline. The system flashes LEDs in a periodic sequence and can be paused/resumed by pushing the button. The specification was taken from a class project that I did in ECE 371.
